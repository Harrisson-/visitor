Description will be update soon but project's goal is to crawl some internet website, keep content and index it inside a bdd, for fun, i thinks it's a crawler, maybe it's a crawler...

Yeah definitly a crawler.
And I will document every analyze i have done to explain how i build the project.

i hope it will not finish like 80% of my projects... unfinished... wish me luck.

## NEXT STEP

- [ ] configure project to manage correctly script (i don't know if i will use a third part app to manage js modules or not, it's a big question for scripts)
- [ ] finish first version db sql script
- [ ] Create first endpoint (juste put ark id list for the begining)


I don't really like third part app who build project's skeleton even it's cool and fast, the risk you miss some configurations problematics is important (my opinion, opinion of a dev who would want to have more time to do something different than algorithms and who would like to be a better dev)
